    "1. Write a Queue class in Python that exposes an enqueue, dequeue, and `__len__` method\n",
    "2. Consider the text file called \"expressions.txt\". This file contains simple arithmetic expressions written in infix notation. Using the Stack class shown in lab 1 or otherwise, write code to implement the [Shunting Yard Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm) to generate postfix expressions. Each expression in expressions.txt is written on a single line. Moreover, each expression contains only numbers comprising a single digit. Each token is separated by whitespace. Write each postfix expression generated to a file \"answers.txt\". Only consider the operations +, -, /, *, and ^.\n",
    "3. Each node in a link list has three field: `data` (storing an int), `next` (storing a pointer to the next node), and `prev` (storing a pointer to the previous node). The link list is ordered in descending order by `data`. Using code or pseudocode, write an algorithm that accepts the `head` of such a link list and an int value `size` that finds the  node with the smallest `data` that is still at least as large as `size`, removes that node from the list, subtracts `size` from the `data` of that node and then reinserts the modified node back into the link list.\n",
