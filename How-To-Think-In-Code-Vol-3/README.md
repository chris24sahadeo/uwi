# How-To-Think-In-Code-Vol-3
Teaching humans how to think logically, conscientiously and creatively through programming in C++

## Foreword
>“Everyone should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think”
> *~ Steve Jobs*

I wrote my first "Hello, World!" program in 2012.
Since then, I've been hooked.

I soon realized that at its core, programming is synonymous with creative and logical thinking. One's programming journey begins with a simple, yet profound foundation, and quickly evolves into complex and immensely useful concepts.  

This repo is dedicated to helping people discover this innate beauty.

Enjoy.
